\title{Validate Corpus Data Frame Object}
\usage{
tif_is_corpus_df(corpus, warn = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{corpus}{a corpus object to test for validity}

\item{warn}{logical. Should the function produce a
verbose warning for the condition for which
the validation fails. Useful for testing.}
}
\value{
a logical vector of length one indicating
               whether the input is a valid corpus
}
\description{
A valid data frame corpus object is an object that
least two columns. The first column is called doc_id
and is a character vector with UTF-8 encoding. Document
ids must be unique. The second column is called text and
must also be a character vector in UTF-8 encoding. Each
individual document is represented by a single row in
the data frame. Addition document-level metadata columns
and corpus level attributes are allowed but not required.
}
\details{
The tests are run sequentially and the function returns,
with a warning if the warn flag is set, on the first test
that fails. We use this implementation because some tests
may fail entirely or be meaningless if the prior ones are
note passed. For example, if the corpus object does not
have a variable named "text" it does not make sense to
check whether this column is a character vector.
