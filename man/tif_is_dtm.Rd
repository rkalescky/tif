\title{Validate Document Term Matrix Object}
\usage{
tif_is_dtm(dtm, warn = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtm}{a document term matrix object to test
the validity of}

\item{warn}{logical. Should the function produce a
verbose warning for the condition for which
the validation fails. Useful for testing.}
}
\value{
a logical vector of length one indicating
              whether the input is a valid document term
              matrix
}
\description{
A valid document term matrix is a sparse matrix with
the row representing documents and columns representing
terms. The row names is a character vector giving the
document ids with no duplicated entries. The column
names is a character vector giving the terms of the
matrix with no duplicated entries. The spare matrix
should inherit from the Matrix class dgCMatrix.
}
\details{
The tests are run sequentially and the function returns,
with a warning if the warn flag is set, on the first test
that fails. We use this implementation because some tests
may fail entirely or be meaningless if the prior ones are
note passed. For example, if the dtm object is not a matrix
it may not contain row or column names.
